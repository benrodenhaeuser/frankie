# README

Frankie is a toy version of Sinatra, i.e., a (drastically) simplified [Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra) clone. I wrote it as part of an effort to understand the Sinatra source code better. A blog post presentation of Frankie is [here](http://notes.benrodenhaeuser.io/2018/06/01/sinatra-from-scratch/).
